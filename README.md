# SONG_LYRICS_GENERATOR
Song Lyrics Generator is an AI/ML project that generates creative song lyrics using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM layers. It takes a seed text input and predicts the next words based on patterns learned from a dataset of song lyrics.
# Features
- Generates lyrics word by word based on a given seed text
  
- Built using TensorFlow and Keras
  
- Trained on real-world song lyrics data
  
- Supports flexible input and output customization
# Technologies Used
- Python
  
- Jupyter Notebook
  
- TensorFlow / Keras
  
- NumPy
  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
# Project Structure
  - Data loading and preprocessing
    
  - Tokenization and sequence creation
    
  - Model building and training
    
  - Text generation logic
# How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/song-lyrics-generator.git
   cd song-lyrics-generator
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells to:
- Train the model or load pretrained weights
- Generate lyrics from your chosen seed text
# How to Use
- Set a custom seed_text in the notebook.

- Adjust the next_words value to control how many words to generate.

- Run the generation cell to get your lyrics.
